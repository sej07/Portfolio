Designed an end-to-end document classification system by fine-tuning BERT-base on 110M parameters for multi-class classification across 11 academic categories, with a modular, production-oriented codebase and validation pipeline

Conducted detailed error analysis using confusion matrices, identifying conceptual overlap between closely related categories and documenting insights to guide future dataset refinement and model improvements
