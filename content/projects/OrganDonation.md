Comprehensive database-driven organ transplant management system handling the complete donation lifecycle. Designed 18 normalized (3NF) tables with automated matching algorithms using weighted scoring (Blood: 30%, HLA: 25%, Wait Time: 20%). Implemented 6 automated triggers, 4 stored procedures, and 4 custom functions for real-time priority-based waitlist management and organ allocation with viability tracking.
