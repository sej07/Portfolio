Built a CNN model to classify plant leaf images into disease categories using the PlantVillage dataset (54,000+ images). Achieved 97% training accuracy and 87% validation accuracy with a custom architecture featuring data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Developed a predictive system for real-time disease detection to support agricultural productivity.
